# Scratchy Chat

Scratchy Chat is a memory-only web-based chat room application that allows users to create or join chat rooms using a room code and exchange messages with others. It uses Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO on the backend, and plain JavaScript with HTML/CSS on the frontend.

## 🚀 Features

- Create or join rooms with 12-digit codes
- Real-time messaging via WebSockets
- User list display and room ownership
- Responsive UI with modals and toasts
- No permanent data storage — messages live in-memory during the session only and they are temporary.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
- **Styling:** Custom dark theme with modular SCSS-like variables
- **Communication:** WebSockets via Socket.IO
