        <h1>Scratchy Chat - Legal Information</h1>
    </header>

            <h2>Privacy & Data Handling</h2>
            <p>
                Scratchy Chat is a web-based chat room application built primarily for temporary, real-time communication. All interactions within the application, such as room creation, messages, and user details, are handled solely in-memory and are not stored permanently. Once a user session ends, all data including chat messages and room details are cleared and cannot be recovered.
            </p>

            <h3>1. No Permanent Data Storage</h3>
            <p>
                Scratchy Chat does not retain any information from the chat rooms, users, or messages beyond the duration of the session. All data, including chat logs and user participation, exists only temporarily in the server’s memory. No permanent storage is employed, and no data is logged for future reference or analysis. No third-party services are used to store or process user data. The application is designed to ensure that all interactions are transient and ephemeral, with no long-term data retention policies in place.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Data Deletion Upon Room Deletion</h3>
            <p>
                When a room is deleted, all associated messages and user data are permanently erased. Once this deletion occurs, the data cannot be recovered by any means. Scratchy Chat operates under the assumption that all chat rooms are ephemeral and will not store any form of user data beyond the active session.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Session and Room Lifetime</h3>
            <p>
                A room’s lifespan is determined by its users. The room and its messages will exist only for as long as the users are connected. If no users are present, the room will be deleted automatically after a certain period of inactivity. This ensures that no residual data remains on the server after the last user leaves or room owner deletes the room.
            </p>

            <h3>4. No User Authentication</h3>
            <p>
                Scratchy Chat does not require any user authentication, accounts, or personally identifiable information (PII) to use the platform. Users are identified solely by their session and room codes.
            </p>

            <h3>Cookies and Tracking</h3>
            <p>
            Scratchy Chat does not use cookies, web beacons, or any form of user tracking. No browsing data, device identifiers, or session analytics are collected or stored.
            </p>
